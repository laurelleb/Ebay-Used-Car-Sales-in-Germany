# Ebay-Used-Car-Sales-in-Germany

In this project, I will explore Car Sales data on the classifieds section of the German eBay site (eBay Kleinanzaigen). The main goal is to clean the data. I will also cover some basic analysis.

The dataset, prepared by Dataquest, and uploaded to kaggle.com can be found here.

## Conlusions

Based on the analysis, I have found that the used cars sold on Ebay's Kleinzaigen cover a variety of brands. However, the most popuar brands are German. Despite the cost and average mileage, buyers still seek luxury brand cars. However, VW leads as the most popular car and brings a great value in terms of price and mileage.

There are many optioins a buyer can choose among mid-range to low-end brands with lower average mileage to save on costs.
